 This Verilog module is a simple comparison module. It takes two 2-bit inputs, A and B, and compares them bit-by-bit. If all the bits of A are equal to the corresponding bits of B, then the output z is set to 1. Otherwise, z is set to 0. The module does not have any internal logic or state transitions, as it is simply a comparison of two inputs. The port connections of the module are as follows: A and B are both 2-bit inputs, and z is a single-bit output.

module TopModule(
	input [1:0] A,
	input [1:0] B,
	output z);
