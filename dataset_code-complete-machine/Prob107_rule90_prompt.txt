The top module is a data load module. When load is 1, it will load the data in the input data to the output q, and when load is 0, it will shift the output q to the right and adding a 0 at the end. 

input

input clk
input load
input [511:0] data

output

output reg [511:0] q

The output q is 512 bits long and is a reg type which can store the value inside.

Declaration

always @(posedge clk) begin

When the clock edge comes, the following operation will be executed.

The operation when load is 1

if (load)
	q <= data;
The input data will be loaded to the output q.

The operation when load is 0

else begin
	q <= q[$bits(q)-1:1] ^ {q[$bits(q)-2:0], 1'b0} ;
end
The last two bits of q are xored, and a 0 is added at the beginning of q.

End the operation

end

	input clk,
	input load,
