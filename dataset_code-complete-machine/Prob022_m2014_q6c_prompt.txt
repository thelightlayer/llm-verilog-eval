 This module is used to generate two outputs, Y2 and Y4, based on the inputs y and w. Y2 is generated by taking the logical AND of the first bit of the input y and the logical NOT of the input w. Y4 is generated by taking the logical AND of the second, third, fifth and sixth bits of the input y and the input w.
