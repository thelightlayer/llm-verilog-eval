 This Verilog module is a simple counter. It has one input, clk, one output, q, and one reset input. The clk input is used to trigger the counter. The reset input is used to reset the counter to 0. The output q is a 4-bit register that stores the current count value.  The module has an always block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal. Inside the always block, an if-else statement is used to determine the next value of q. If the reset input is asserted or the current value of q is equal to 9, then q is reset to 0. Otherwise, q is incremented by 1.
