 This module is a simple two-input, one-output logic circuit. It takes two inputs, a and b, and produces an output, out. The output is the logical negation of the exclusive-or (XOR) of the two inputs. This means that the output will be true (1) when the inputs are not equal and false (0) when the inputs are equal. The module is implemented using a single assign statement, which assigns the output to the logical negation of the XOR of the two inputs.
