The top module is a register that uses the input "load" to determine whether to load the value in data into q. 
If load is true, q is set to the value of data.
If load is false, q is set to the result of the bitwise operation:
Not(
(q[511:1] and q[511:0] and {q[510:0], 1'b0}) or
(not(q[511:1]) and not(q[511:0]) and not({q[510:0], 1'b0})) or  
(q[511:1] and not(q[511:0]) and not({q[510:0], 1'b0})) )

The port connections of the instantiated modules are:
clk is connected to the clock input of q
load is connected to the load input of q
data is connected to the data input of q
q is connected to the output of q



module TopModule(
	input clk,
	input load,
	input [511:0] data,
	output reg [511:0] q);
