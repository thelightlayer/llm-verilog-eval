 This top module is used to perform a variety of logical operations on two inputs, a and b. The module has seven outputs, out_and, out_or, out_xor, out_nand, out_nor, out_xnor, and out_anotb.   The out_and output is the result of a logical AND operation between inputs a and b. This means that the output will be high (1) only if both inputs are high (1).   The out_or output is the result of a logical OR operation between inputs a and b. This means that the output will be high (1) if either input is high (1).  The out_xor output is the result of a logical XOR operation between inputs a and b. This means that the output will be high (1) if either input is high (1) but not if both inputs are high (1).  The out_nand output is the result of a logical NAND operation between inputs a and b. This means that the output will be low (0) only if both inputs are high (1).  The out_nor output is the result of a logical NOR operation between inputs a and b. This means that the output will be low (0) if either input is high (1).  The out_xnor output is the result of a logical XNOR operation between inputs a and b. This means that the output will be low (0) if either input is high (1) but not if both inputs are high (1).  The out_anotb output is the result of a logical AND NOT operation between inputs a and b. This means that the output will be high (1) only if input a is high (1) and input b is low (0).
