 This Verilog module is a simple combinational circuit that takes an input and produces an inverted output. The input port is named "in" and the output port is named "out". The output is assigned to the inverse of the input, meaning that if the input is 0, the output will be 1, and if the input is 1, the output will be 0. This module does not have any internal logic or state transitions, it simply takes the input and inverts it.
