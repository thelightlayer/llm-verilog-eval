 This Verilog module is a simple 4-bit counter. It has three inputs: clk, reset, and q. The clk input is a clock signal, which is used to trigger the counter to increment. The reset input is a signal that, when asserted, will reset the counter to 0. The q output is a 4-bit register that holds the current value of the counter.  The module is implemented using an always block. This block is triggered on the rising edge of the clk signal. When the block is triggered, it first checks the reset signal. If the reset signal is asserted, the counter is reset to 0. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1. The incremented value is then stored in the q register.
