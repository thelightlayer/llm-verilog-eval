The top module has four parameters and two ports.
The state parameter is a 4 bit input port.
The in parameter is a 1 bit input port.
The next_state parameter is a 4 bit output port.
The out parameter is a 1 bit output port.

The top module has four assign statements.
The first assign statement assigns values to the next_state[A] port.
This port depends on the state[A] and state[C] ports and the in port.
If the in port is low then the port is assigned to the ORed value of state[A] and state[C].
If the in port is high the port is assigned to zero.

The second assign statement assigns values to the next_state[B] port.
This port depends on the state[A], state[B] and state[D] ports and the in port.
If the in port is low then the port is assigned to zero.
If the in port is high then the port is assigned to the ORed value of the state[A], state[B], and state[D] ports.

The third assign statement assigns values to the next_state[C] port.
This port depends on the state[B] and state[D] ports and the in port.
If the in port is low then the port is assigned to the ORed value of the state[B] and state[D] ports.
If the in port is high the port is assigned to zero.

The forth assign statement assigns values to the next_state[D] port.
This port depends on the state[C] port and the in port.
If the in port is low then the port is assigned to zero.
If the in port is high then the port is assigned to the state[C] port.

The out port depends on the state[D] port.
The out port is assigned to the value of the state[D] port.
