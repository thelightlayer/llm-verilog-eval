    The top module is a logic gate that receives x and y inputs and returns the z output.
    The x input is the a input for the first gate and the b input for the second gate.
    The y input is the b input for the first gate and the a input for the second gate.
    The output of the first gate is the a input for the third gate.
    The output of the second gate is the b input for the third gate.
    The output of the third gate is the z output.
