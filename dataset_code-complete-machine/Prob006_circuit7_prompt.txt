 This Verilog module is a simple combinational logic circuit that has one input (a) and one output (q). It is triggered by a clock signal (clk) and has a register (q) that stores the output value. The module uses a positive edge triggered always block to implement the logic. When the clock signal goes from low to high, the output q is set to the inverse of the input a. This means that when the input a is high, the output q will be low and vice versa. The module will continuously update the output q whenever the clock signal changes from low to high.
