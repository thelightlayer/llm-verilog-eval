 This top Verilog module is a simple module that assigns the output zero to a value of 0. This module does not have any inputs and is used to assign a constant value to the output. This module is useful when a constant value is needed for a design. For example, if a design requires a signal to be always 0, this module can be used to assign the output zero to 0. This module can also be used to assign a constant value to a signal that is used as an input to another module.

	output zero);
