 This Verilog module is a simple parity checker. It has one 8-bit input port, "in", and one output port, "parity". The output port is assigned to the bitwise XOR of the 8-bit input port. This means that the output will be a single bit that is 1 if the number of 1s in the 8-bit input is odd, and 0 if the number of 1s in the 8-bit input is even. This module can be used to detect errors in 8-bit data.
